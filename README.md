# Sudoku Unique Solution Checker

This repository contains a Python script that uses recursion and backtracking to determine whether a given Sudoku puzzle has a unique solution. The algorithm systematically fills empty cells, exploring possible numbers and ensuring that only one valid solution exists.

## How It Works

- **Recursion & Backtracking:** The code recursively attempts to fill in the grid while backtracking if a conflict arises.
- **Uniqueness Check:** It tracks solutions to verify that the puzzle does not have multiple valid completions.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sudoku-unique-solution-checker.git
